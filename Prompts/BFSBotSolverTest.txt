Generate a Vitest test file for the bot solver logic used in Race mode.

File to create:
src/test/botSolver.test.js

Goal:
Test that computeBotMoves (the BFS solver) always returns the shortest possible path to the goal state.

Requirements:
1. Import computeBotMoves from its module.
2. Define the solved goal board for a 3×3 puzzle:
   const goal = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0];

3. Define several known test boards with known optimal solution lengths:
   - One move away:
     [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,8]
     (optimal: 1)
   - Two moves away:
     [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,7,8]
     (optimal: 2)
   - Three moves away:
     [1,2,3,4,0,6,7,5,8]
     (optimal: 3)

4. For each board:
   - Call computeBotMoves(startBoard)
   - Expect:
       result is an array
       result.length === expectedOptimalLength
   - Optionally, apply the returned moves to reach the goal and verify it equals `goal`.

5. Use describe/it structure from Vitest.
6. Keep the test pure BFS (no difficulty modifiers).
