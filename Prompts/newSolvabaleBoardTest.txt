Generate a new Vitest test file for utils/shuffle.js.

Goal:
Test newSolvableBoard(size) across multiple sizes (3, 4, 5) to ensure that:
1. The board contains size*size tiles.
2. The board contains all numbers from 0 to size*size - 1 with no duplicates.
3. The board is solvable using correct inversion rules for N-puzzles.
4. The board differs on each generation (i.e., not returning identical boards every time).

Test requirements:
- Loop through sizes [3, 4, 5].
- For each size, generate 10 boards and validate all rules.
- Implement a small local "isSolvable" helper inside the test
  (count inversions, apply blank-row parity rules for odd/even sizes).
- Do NOT import your internal solver unless it's already exported for testing.

File output:
src/test/newSolvableBoard.test.js
