Generate an SVG logo that represents a sliding puzzle grid for a game called “TileRush”.

Requirements:
- 3×3 grid of rounded squares.
- Each square should be 25×25.
- Rounded corners: rx=4.
- Overall SVG size: 140×140, viewBox="0 0 100 100".
- Use three green color shades:
  #22C55E
  #16A34A
  #15803D
- The arrangement of colors must match this pattern, row by row:
  Row 1: #22C55E, #16A34A, #15803D
  Row 2: #15803D, #22C55E, #16A34A
  Row 3: #16A34A, #15803D, #22C55E
- Leave a small gap between the squares (same as your original spacing: x=5, 37.5, 70).
- Output only clean, formatted SVG code with no surrounding explanation.

After generating the base version, also generate 2 optional variations:
1. A version with a slight 3D shadow under each tile.
2. A version with tiles having a subtle gradient instead of flat colors.

Do not change the overall layout or spacing.
